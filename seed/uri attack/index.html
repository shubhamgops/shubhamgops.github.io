                    <h2>Short Story</h2>
                    <p>The 2016 Uri attack was an attack by four heavily armed terrorists on 18 September 2016, near the town of Uri in the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir. It was reported as "the deadliest attack on security forces in Kashmir in two decades".No group has claimed responsibility for the attack,though the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed is suspected of being involved in the planning and execution of the attack.At the time of the attack, the Kashmir Valley region was at the centre of unrest, during which 85 civilians had been killed and thousands injured in clashes with security forces.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Since 2015, the militants have increasingly taken to high-profile fidayeen attacks against the Indian security forces: in July 2015, three gunmen attacked a bus and police station in Gurdaspur and earlier in 2016 4–6 gunmen attacked the Pathankot Air Force Station. Indian authorities blamed Jaish-e-Mohammad for the latter attack.</p>

                <p>Also, since 8 July 2016, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir has been undergoing continuous unrest following the killing of Burhan Wani, commander of the group Hizbul Mujahideen popular with the young generation of the state, though the group has been declared a terrorist organization by India, the European Union and the United States.The killing sparked violent protests against the Indian government in the valley, leading to the protests being described as the "largest anti-India protests" against Indian rule in recent years.</p>

                <p>During the protests, at least 87 civilians have been killed.Thousands have been injured, including several Indian security personnel. The violence has been described as the worst since 2010. The Indian security forces have been criticized by human rights groups[which?] for using excessive force.</p>

                <h3>Attack</h3>
                <p>At around 5:30 a.m. on 18 September, four militants attacked an Indian Army brigade headquarters in Uri, near the Line of Control in a pre-dawn ambush. They were said [by whom?] to have lobbed 17 grenades in three minutes. As a rear administrative base camp with tents caught fire, [clarification needed] army personnel were killed. A gun battle ensued lasting six hours, during which all the four militants were killed. An additional 19-30 soldiers were reported to have been injured in the attack. Combing operations continued to flush out additional terrorists thought to be alive.</p>
                
                <p>Most of the soldiers killed were from the 10 Dogra and 6 Bihar regiments.One of the injured soldiers succumbed to his injuries on 19 September at R&R Hospital in New Delhi, followed by another soldier on 24 September, bringing the death toll to 19.</p>

                <p>The casualties were primarily believed due to have occurred as a result of non-fire retardant transition tents. This was the time of a troops shift, whereby the 6 Bihar regiment was replacing the 10 Dogra regiment. The incoming troops were housed in tents, which are normally avoided in sensitive areas around LOC like Uri. The attackers sneaked into the camp breaching heavy security and seemed[clarification needed] to know exactly where to strike. Seven of the personnel killed were support staff, including cooks and barbers.</p>

                <h3>Aftermath</h3>
                <p>On 19 September, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, Chief of the Army Staff Dalbir Singh, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and other officials of the Home and Defence ministries met to review the security situation in Kashmir, particularly in areas along the Line of Control. The National Investigation Agency filed a first information report regarding the attack and took over the investigation from Jammu and Kashmir Police on 20 September.</p>

                <p>Pakistan International Airlines cancelled flights to certain parts of Kashmir on 21 September in the aftermath of the attack.Security around the Army installation in Uri was intensified following the attack, while soldiers on both the Indian and Pakistani side of Line of Control were placed on high alert.</p>

                <h2>Military conflict</h2>
                <p>On September 29, eleven days after the attack, the Indian army said it conducted "surgical strikes" against suspected militants in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said that it had made a pre-emptive strike against "terrorist teams" who were preparing to "carryout infiltration and conduct terrorist strikes inside Jammu and Kashmir and in various metros in other states".</p>

                <p>Pakistan rejected the claim of a surgical strike, stating that India rather cross-border fired upon Pakistani soldiers, killing 2 Pakistani soldiers and wounding 9. Pakistan called the attack "unprovoked" and termed it "naked aggression", and warned India that Pakistan would respond "militarily" to such an attack. It was noted that the details regarding the attack were still unclear. Some Indian media claimed that the Indian army infiltrated 2–3 km into Pakistani territory, but the Indian army did not say whether its troops crossed the border or had simply fired across it. Later, Pakistani sources reported that up to 14 Indian soldiers were killed in retaliatory firing and one was captured, Chandu Bablulal Chohan. An Indian Army source confirmed the capture of a soldier from 37 Rashtriya Rifles, but declined the reports by the Pakistani media about the killing of 14 Indian soldiers in retaliatory firing by saying, "As regards the report of killing of eight Indian Army personnel reported in sections of Pakistan media, the report is completely false and baseless" and claimed the soldier who was captured had "inadvertently crossed over to the Pakistan side which is not unusual on either side."</p>

                <h2>Investigation</h2>
                <p>The Director General of military operations, Lieutenant-General Ranbir Singh, said that there was evidence that the attackers belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammad. He established a hotline contact with his Pakistani counterpart and conveyed India's serious concern on the issue.Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh has also stated that the militants used incendiary ammunition to set fire to the tents.</p>

                <p>On 25 September, the Indian Army said that two Pakistani nationals[a] in Azad Kashmir were arrested by the Border Security Force in the Uri sector. They were said to have been recruited by Jaish-e-Mohammad two years ago for the purpose of acting as guides to infiltrating groups in the Uri sector. These guides themselves did not have a role in the Uri attack. They were being questioned for gathering intelligence about infiltration attempts. Pakistan denied these allegations.</p>

                <p>An initial investigation into the attack indicated that there were several procedural lapses at the camp. According to the standard security procedures, any tall grass and bushes around vital security installations should be cut. However, this procedure was not followed by the Uri camp which might have allowed terrorists to sneak into the camp undetected using the tall grass and bushes around the perimeter. In addition, the probe also indicated that two manned guard posts failed to detect the intrusion because the coordination between them might have been poor. It also indicated that the terrorists had infiltrated into Indian territory through Haji Peer Pass on the intervening night of 16–17 September and stayed at Sukhdar village which is located at a vantage point that allows an unhindered view of the layout of the camp as well as movement of the personnel in it.</p>
